# Handwritten Character Recognition

This project is aimed at developing a **handwritten character recognition** system using deep learning techniques. It involves training a model to recognize and classify characters based on images of handwritten inputs.

## Overview

Handwritten character recognition is an important application in optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This project implements a model capable of recognizing handwritten characters from a dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of handwritten characters, and the task is to recognize and classify these characters correctly. The images are preprocessed to fit the model's input requirements.

## Key Features

- **Preprocessing**: The raw images undergo a series of preprocessing steps such as thresholding, resizing, and normalizing.
- **Model Training**: A deep learning model is trained using the preprocessed data. The model architecture includes layers like convolutional layers, dense layers, and an output layer suitable for classification tasks.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **OpenCV** for image processing.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the deep learning model.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
